this program will evaluate equity of different pockets in poker Texas Holdem

algorithm is the next:
     - on preflop all players stake 1 chip in the pot 
     - no further trading take place
     - after river all players go to showdown
     - winning hand add pot to the stack
     - if pot splitted the sum is splitted too
in the end program put out results:
format : [table_size] [pocket_card1 pocket_card2 suit/unsuit] [rate]
neutral pocket is the pocket with rate just 0.0
if rate > 0.0 then this pocket has positive equity
if rate < 0.0 then this pocket has negative equity

to compile from the sources you need to install 'ocaml' compiler on your computer
you need only basic level - no additional libraries are required untill u want to test
sources - in this case u need to install OUnit library

you also need 'bash shell' and 'make utility' 

to compile from the source files , in terminal :

   cd src/
   make a.out

this command will create executable file a.out in project root dir
you will receive a lot of warnings during compilation - its ok because
in each case right conditions tested in code, so dont warry

after that :

  cd ../
  ./a.out 111000 > filename

where param is number of hands for each table size (should be more then 34K for reliable results)
this command will create result file in format : [table_size] [card1 card2 suit] [rate]

thats all

enjoy !
