to compile from sources you need to install 'ocaml' language on your computer
you also need 'bash shell' and 'make' have been installed

to compile from source files , in terminal :

   cd src/
   make

this command will create executable file a.out in project root dir
you will receive a lot of warnings during compilation - its ok because right conditions tested in code, so dont warry

after that :

  cd ../
  ./a.out 111000

where params is number of hands for each table size
this command will create result file in format [table_size] [card1 card2 suit] [rate]

thats all

enjoy !
