to compile from sources you need to install 'ocaml' language on your computer
you also need 'bash shell' and 'make' been installed

to compile from source files , in terminal :

   make

this command will create executable file a.out
you will receive a lot of warnings during compilation - its ok because right conditions tested in code, so dont warry

after that :

  ./myscript

this command will create 9 files in dir "rez" with names [2-0].txt

after that :

      cd rez
      ./dowork.sh

last command will create 9 files with names [2-0].data
they are plain text files with results in format [card][card][suited] [rate]

thats all

enjoy !
