this program will evaluate equity of different pockets in poker Texas Holdem

algorithm is the next:
     - all players start with stack = 0 (and they can stake making the stack be negative)
     - on preflop all players stake 1 chip into the pot 
     - no further trading take place
     - after river all players go to showdown
     - winning hand adds pot to its stack
     - if pot splitted then the sum is splitted too
     
at the end program put out results in format :

   [table_size] [pocket_card1 pocket_card2 suit/unsuit] [equity]

all pockets are evaluated by formula :

    equity = final_pocket_stack / num_of_hands_pocket_presented

to compile from the sources you need to install 'ocaml' compiler on your computer
you need only basic level - no additional libraries are required untill u want to test
sources - in this case u need to install OUnit library

you also need 'bash shell' and 'make utility' 

the progam WILL NOT BE INSTALLED anywere on your computer.
instead exec file will be created just in the root dir of the project

to compile from the source files , in terminal :

   cd src/
   make a.out

this command will create executable file 'a.out' in project root dir

NB: you will receive a lot of warnings during compilation - its ok because
    in each case right conditions tested in code, so dont warry

after that :

  cd ../
  ./a.out 111000 > filename

where param is number of hands for each table size (should be more then 34K for reliable results)
this command will create result file in format : [table_size] [card1 card2 suit] [rate]

thats all

enjoy !
